Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?
 Yes. I have failed the exam because I got too lazy to study. I also didn't have notes in that subject.

How was you first experience of CSB Midterm Examination? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to doagain for the CSB Finals?

 At first I was nervous but then it was not very hard. I'll Study again. :)
